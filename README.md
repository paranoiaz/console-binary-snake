# Console Binary Snake
A binary themed snake game made for the terminal. Works for both Windows and Linux systems but you will have to set the DISPLAY environment variable for Linux to use one of the dependencies required.

**Dependencies**
```
pynput
colorama
```

**Notes**

Edit the config.yml to your preferences, a lower value for the speed makes the game play faster and a lower value for the size makes the grid smaller. Values too low or high may break the game so be cautious.
